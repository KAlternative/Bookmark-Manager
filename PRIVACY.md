üìö Bookmark Manager ‚Äì Privacy Policy

Last updated: September 27, 2025

Introduction

Bookmark Manager is a Chrome extension that allows you to organize, search, and manage your bookmarks locally in a new tab. We value your privacy and want to be transparent about what data is collected and how it is used.

Data Collection and Usage

This extension does not collect or transmit any personally identifiable information, financial data, authentication credentials, or communications.

The only data stored is:

Bookmarks you add (URLs, names, categories, tags).

Preferences (theme selection, sort order, category filters).

Usage state (statistics like the number of bookmarks in each category).

This data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome‚Äôs storage APIs. It is not transmitted to any external server or third party.

External Requests

The extension may make requests to:

Google Favicon Service (https://www.google.com/s2/favicons) to fetch website icons for your bookmarks.

No browsing history, cookies, or personal data are shared during this request.

Web History Disclosure

The extension allows users to save website URLs as bookmarks. For this reason, it may store the list of web pages you explicitly choose to add. This information is stored only on your device and never sent elsewhere.

Data Sharing

‚ùå We do not sell, rent, or trade user data.

‚ùå We do not transfer user data to third parties.

‚ùå We do not use data for advertising, creditworthiness, or unrelated purposes.

Security

Since all data is stored locally, you are in full control of your information. Uninstalling the extension will remove all locally stored data.

Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in this document, and the "Last updated" date will be revised.
